# Scraping
Some small scraping projects

## Curva DI
For this project, the goal is to scrap a brazilian interest curve (available online) and interpolate between the vertices available. The output format is an .xlsx file.

There are two versions of this, corresponding to different swaps of interest rates.

## Debentures
Here, the goal is to periodically download and move the files available online, containing historical data about 'debentures' transactions.

In order to run properly, the code needs to be modified to the appropriate output destination.
